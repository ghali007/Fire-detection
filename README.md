# Fire-detection


## Description
This repository serves as a Fire detection methods using deep learning models. The goal is to easily be able to implement, train, and test new fire detection models! Complete with the following:

- Training and testing modes
- Data augmentation
- Several state-of-the-art models. Easily **plug and play** with different models
- Able to use **any** dataset
- Evaluation including precision, recall, f1 score, average accuracy, per-class accuracy, and mean IoU
- Plotting of loss function and accuracy over epochs
