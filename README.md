# Fire-detection


## Description
This repository serves as a Fire detection methods using deep learning models. The goal is to easily be able to implement, train, and test new fire detection models! Complete with the following:

- Training and testing modes
- Data augmentation
- Several state-of-the-art models. 
- Dataset of fire-like objects such as sunrise, light, sunset, etc...
- Able to use **any** dataset
- Evaluation including precision, recall, f1 score, average accuracy.
